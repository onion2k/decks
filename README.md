# Decks

## What is Decks

Decks is an online record player, complete with warm crackly background noise, web video based playback, and a few other options (and more to come).

## Running Decks

Clone the repo in to a fresh directory and use `npm i && npm run start` to initialise it on port 3000, then point a browser at http://localhost:3000/ (if it doesn't happen automatically).

TODO:

* Improve the UI. Make it easier to create playlists
* New track component with progress bar
* Make it responsive.. tape on mobile?
